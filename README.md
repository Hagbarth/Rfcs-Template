# Rfcs-Template

This is an extension of the Team Handbook Template but can be used on its own.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the platform, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the platform is evolving in.

I wanted to put what I've learned into practice, so I decided to write my own RFC Template and open source it.

This repository contains the RFC process that we use here. It represents many hours of research, lots of thoughtful debates, and some serious introspection. It’s certainly not perfect, but I think it’s an exciting place to start.

Feel free to fork this repository and use any or all of these processes, and to modify them in whatever way makes sense for your company. I hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from my research and improve their own teams change process.

All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. I’ve gotten several different perspectives to help arrive at these policies, but I am certainly missing many more and making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that I hope will get better with more time and more contributors.
