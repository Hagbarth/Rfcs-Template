## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the change.

## Impact of Change

> This should be assigned on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is low, and 5 is high. The following
table outlines the definition of the levels of impact.:

| Risk Level  | Definition            | Test & Validation  | 
|:-----|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| 5    | High potential impact to large number of users or business critical service. This change is global in its nature. System downtime is required. Example: Introduction of new product, software, topology or feature. | Requires significant validation of new solution (potentially involving Architecture & Development) including documented testing, validation and ‘what-if’ analysis showing impact to existing infrastructure; completion of support documentation, back-out plan, risk assessment and implementation plan. It is recommended that the solution is first piloted and a design review is carried out before testing. |      
| 4    | High potential impact to large number of users or business critical service. Change probably requires system downtime. Example:- Large increase in traffic or users, backbone or network routing changes | Requires ‘what-if’ analysis performed to determine the impact to the existing environment; testing, implementation, risk analysis and back-out plans. A design review for any major infrastructure changes          | 
| 3    | Medium impact to smaller number of users or business service. Example:- As 1 & 2, but fewer users affected.   | Requires analysis of new solution which may require validation. Will require implementation, risk analysis and back-out plan.           | 
| 2    | Low potential impact. Example:- Adding new standard template modules, providing additional proven access services.                       | Requires implementation and back-out plan.         | 
| 1    | No user or service impact. Example:- adding individual users to network; standard configuration changes (password change, monitoring discovery or similar configuration parameters), no expected service or user downtime     | Low impact low complexity change eg. Data or report change          | 

## Potential business impact 

> If the change were to subsequently fail during business hours, which users would be affected, and for how long?

> If the change were to fail during the change iplementation, and had to be backed out, what would be the business impact of not carrying out the change?

> If the change were to be rejected what would be the business impact?

> Consideration should be given to the timing of the change; business critical times should be avoided, if possible. 

## Risk and issues analysis 

> The amount of detail required in the risk analysis will be dependent upon the impact of the change. For all changes with an anticipated impact level of 3-5, a risk/issue analysis must be included.

## Back-Out Plan

> The amount of detail required in the back-out plan will be dependent upon the impact of the change. A back-out plan must be created for all changes with an anticipated impact level of 2-5

> There are two elements to the back-out plan:-

> 1) How the change will be backed out if a problem is encountered whilst the change is being made.

> 2) How the change will be backed out if a problem subsequently occurs (post change) during business hours

> A list of personnel who should be available in the event of invocation of the back-out plan should be included.

> A mandatory requirement is that the time at which the back-out plan should be invoked, if necessary, should be included in order to remain within the proposed time window.

> The time required in order to execute the back-out plan should also be included. (i.e. the time required to restore the status quo).

> The plan will include all personnel/third party contact details, as necessary, who will contact them, and under what circumstances. 

## Test Plan

> This should detail the testing either carried out prior to the change request being completed or planned prior to the change (if conditionally approved). The amount of detail required will be dependent upon the impact of the proposed change.

> Details required are:-

> 1) What testing has already taken place, or is planned in order to ensure the maximum chance of success (pre-implementation test plan).

> 2) What testing will take place after implementation to ensure that the change was successful (post-implementation test plan).

> The following information should be provided:

> 1. How was/is the change to be tested?
> 1. How did/will the testing take place?
> 1. Who will perform the tests?
> 1. Does anyone need to be on standby during the tests? 
> 1. Who will be notified that the change has/has not been completed
successfully? 

## Other systems/services impacted 

> Any impact on other services or systems must be understood and explicitly stated in the request.

## Additional comments

> Any other relevant or additional information which may be of interest should be included.
